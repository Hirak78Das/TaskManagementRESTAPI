# Enums in java

- when you have some values in your project, which you know that it will not change, then put those values in a enums class.
- Enum is a class used to store constant values Enum can be used inside other class(public, private, protected) or a seperate class(only public)
- Enum can implement interface not extend(cuz it implicitly extends java.lang.Enum)
- Enum is implicitly public, static and final(cannot be overriden)
